# Stellar Classification

## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify stars based on different astronomical parameters. Stellar classification is an important task in astronomy, helping us understand the evolution, properties, and distribution of stars in the universe. We employ a Random Forest Classifier due to its robustness and good performance on the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle: [Star Type Classification Dataset]([Star Type Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepu1109/star-dataset))
